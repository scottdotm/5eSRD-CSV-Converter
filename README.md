# 5eSRD-CSV-Converter
5eSRD API pulled down, and created CSV files.

In the process of developing a DND application with a group from college. We used the 5eSRD API in that project. Me and another group member have decided to keep working on the project and do a full rewrite.
Part of that rewrite has been to pull down the data from the API due to our goals.

##Converter
Python script that does what it says, it takes the API and delivers us a CSV, then you can break that down anyway you desire.

##CSV's
These corrolate with the API, however you could use these to create your own database from the data of the API.


This is a small part of a larger plan going forward for custom content in our applicaiton. 
I hope someone might find this usefull. Cheer.
